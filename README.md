# HIDAPI library for Windows

This library is a fork of the [hidapi](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi).
The design objective of **libhidapi for Windows** is to provide a better
out-of-the-box experience for AVRDUDE Windows users.

Currently, the Windows related code does no longer required any patches,
so it is identical with the upstream version.

In the long term, the Windows version of AVRDUDE should use the official
hidapi library, and this library will be deprecated.

The latest version of libhidapi for Windows can be found here:\
<https://github.com/avrdudes/libhidapi>

The original README of hidapi can be found here: [README-old.md](./README-old.md).
